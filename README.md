## 💼 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/), delivering robust backend systems and scalable cloud-native applications.

With more than **3.5+ years** of experience, I specialize in building distributed systems, developer tools, onboarding workflows and internal platforms.

- 🧠 Strong in architecture, fast in delivery and mindful of scale.  
- ⚙️ I enjoy tackling real business challenges with clean, performant code.  
- 🚀 Tech that runs fast and makes sense — that’s what I build.

I believe great software solves real problems and empowers people. I build fast, think big and ship smart.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> *"A senior dev should solve any problem, not just the one assigned."*

I live by this. Whether it’s unblocking a team or picking the right architecture, I step in where needed. I care deeply about **clarity**, **autonomy** and **momentum** — and I ship with all three.
