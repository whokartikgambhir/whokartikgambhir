I believe great software solves real problems and empowers people. I build fast, think big and ship smart.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> *"A senior dev should solve any problem, not just the one assigned."*

I live by this. Whether it’s unblocking a team or picking the right architecture, I step in where needed. I care deeply about **clarity**, **autonomy** and **momentum** - and I ship with all three.
